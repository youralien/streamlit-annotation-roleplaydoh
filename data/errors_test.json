But beneath that, there's this undercurrent of... I don't know, unrest? It's not always present, but when it is, it's all-consuming. I'm trying to be patient with myself, to recognize that maybe there's a part of me that's just not healed yet, even though I can't pinpoint what's broken. It's hard not to feel a little hopeless when these coping strategies seem to fail at random times. I'm not giving up, though. I'm here, talking to you, trying to make sense of it all. I just wish I could understand what's triggering me, so I could address it directly. But for now, I'll keep searching for those moments of peace and hold onto them as tightly as I can when the urges come. It's all I can do, really."
